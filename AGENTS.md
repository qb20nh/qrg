# Agent Instructions

## General Principles

When working on this project, follow these core principles:

1. **Maintainability** - Write code that's easy to understand and modify. Keep concerns separated into logical modules. Use clear naming conventions.

2. **Readability** - Prioritize clarity over cleverness. Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep functions and files focused and reasonably sized.

3. **Performance (Efficiency)** - Keep the extension lightweight and fast.

4. **Simplicity** - Keep the extension intuitive and easy to use. Simple workflows, clear UI, minimal clicks. Users should understand the extension's purpose at a glance. Avoid feature bloat.

5. **Transparency** - No code minification, obfuscation, or external APIs. Keep the code human-readable and auditable. The extension should only act on explicit user requests—never perform unexpected background operations or communicate with external services.
